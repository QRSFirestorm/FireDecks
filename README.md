# The Fire Decks Mod

This is a mod I made that adds a bunch of decks, mostly just depending on whatever I feel like creating

## My goal is to continue adding decks, at least once a month

# The current decks are:
# The Soul Deck
While playing the Soul Deck, you will receive a soul card when starting your run.
However, you will also be starting with -$25
CHICOT INCOMING

# The PhotoChad Deck
In the PhotoChad Deck, you start with an eternal photochad combo.
Hopefully, it is strong enough to beat the 2.5x ante scaling!
*Wait, it's all photochad?*
*Always has been*

# The Tax Deck
The Tax Deck gives you a nice $25 to start with!
Unfortunately, the tax rates are high, and you lose $2 per remaining hand and $1 per remaining discard
Someone really needs to reduce the rates

# The Greedy Deck
The (least tested) Greedy Deck gives you $100, Seed Money, AND Money Tree to start your run with,
It comes at a price, though, because both your chips and mult are halved. You also lose a joker slot
To try and make the early game possible, the ante scaling was reduced to 0.8x

# The v1.0 Mega Deck
The v1.0 Mega Deck combines every deck added in this version. Here is a list of all of the effects:
- Start with $92
- Start with Seed Money + Money Tree
- Start with a Soul card
- 2.3x Ante Scaling
- -$2 per remaining hand
- -$1 per remaining discard
- -1 Joker slot
- Eternal Photochad
- Chips and Mult are halved

# Unemployed Deck
In the Unemployed Deck, you will start with $300!
Unfortunately, having no job means no income, so you gain no interest, and extra hands give $0.
(UPDATE TO THIS DECK COMING REMOVING BLIND MONEY WHEN I FIGURE OUT HOW TO)

# Burglar Deck
Inspired by the burglar joker, this deck gives you 3 extra hands per round, at the cost of having no discards
We getting leftover hand value with this one

# Needle Deck
*Almost* taken directly from the boss 'The Needle'
You can only play 1 hand, and the ante scaling is reduced to 3/4.

# Copy Deck
By far the most unbalanced one in here, this deck is all about copying things
Start with an Eternal DNA, a Cryptid card, an Ankh card, a Fool card, and the Crystal Ball voucher!
Printer deck coming soon

# Mega Deck v2.0
The Mega Deck for v2.0 is pretty easy!
Here's what you'll encounter:
- 4 hands (+3 from burglar, -3 from needle)
- 0 discards
- $300 starting cash
- No interest
- $0 for each remaining hand
- 0.75x ante scaling
- Eternal DNA
- Cryptid Card
- Fool Card
- Ankh Card
- Crystal Ball Voucher

Thanks for checking out my mod, and I hope you enjoy it!
